- splitted the list with linkedin profils in companies and peoples

## 2024-09-04

- get in contact wirh the apify actor
- susspisious about the data completeness if webbased buld loading is used.
- reasons for using the api via pyhton instead of webbased scraping:
  - seems to be more reliable, when scraping one company after another, instead of all at once
  - more control over the data
  - output is directly in json on the dekstop

### done today:

- pyhton script for scraping single linkedin profils `single_linkedin_profil.py`
